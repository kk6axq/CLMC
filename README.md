# CLMC (Closed Loop Motor Controller)
This is a closed loop brushed DC motor controller project, completed for an honors enrichment contract in EGR101 at Arizona State University. The goal was to develop the hardware and software to enabled PID based control of position, velocity, and acceleration in an encoder equipped motor. So far, the project has met its minimum requirements, however there are several areas to improve. For more background on the project and architectures, see the Wiki.
